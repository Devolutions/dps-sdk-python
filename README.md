# Devolutions Password Server SDK - Python

The ***Devolutions Password Server*** API is a REST API that provides developers the tools to have their applications access their ***Devolutions Password Server*** Instance(s) and their content (notably entries for credentials and sessions), and aspects of these entries (such as security settings, documentation, etc.). With this API, users can build custom applications which can use any development language to access the API.

This open source SDK is the Python implementation of a library to consume this REST API.
